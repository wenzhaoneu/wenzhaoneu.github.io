## Write up for A1:

##What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging is to make my website mobile-friendly. I need to update GitHub frequently and see if it has any effect after I change the features. The most difficult part is to adjust navbar to make it meet the requirements. It is not easy to do that. It took me 2 days to try what is the best view for the user.

###What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?

I hope to let my navbar sit at the bottom so that it will not block the contents and make room for my other contents. I also change the arrangement of the content to make it more easy and simple to read. I also change the meta setting so that it could match the screen size and not overflow the screen.

####What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

The first thing I think about is to deliver my ideas and contents elegantly. So I adopt the CSS grid to help me arrange the website. I hope it could look more comfortable and convenient to get the infor about me.

####Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

I would consider adding music and videos to my website. And one more feature to leave some ideas after everyone visits this web. There will be a special block to present any comments or wishes or anything else to share. And add a forward icon on the menu bar so that it is to forward to anyone who is interested in this website. I spend 4 days on this assignment. It is not hard to compete but hard for me to meet all the requirements.
